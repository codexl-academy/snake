# Snake

Snake Videogame made with Python.

We should (probably) create a version of this [implementation](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/snake-game-in-python-using-pygame-module/) from GeeksForGeeks.

## Free Version

1. Install required packages. Probably just `pygame`.
1. Import libraries and set initial dimensions of the game.
1. Start an instance of the game with an empty rectangle.
1. Initial position of the snake, size, generation of fruits.
1. Score.
1. Game over.
1. Snake movement, fruit spawn logic, etc... This can be split probably.

This is more or less the steps they follow on that tutorial. We should do something similar, but maybe a little bit less spaghetti. I would like to use Object-Oriented programming for this project.

## Premium Version

1. Multiplayer.
1. VS Computer Player.
1. VS Optimal Computer Player (Graph Algorithms, Heuristics).

## Project Organization

So far, I think something like this could suffice:

- A `src` folder with the final implementation. Subfolders will be created as needed.
- A `chapters` (maybe a different name) folder with subfolders containing the content specific for one day. Each subfolder should have the code made from day 1 to the current day. Also, the explanatory text should be inside each subfolder as the corresponding text for that chapter.
